  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_title: 'What is Urban Dance?',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_definition:
    'Urban dances are dance styles born in the streets, plazas and neighborhoods of different cities around the world. They\'re called "urban" because they emerged outside theaters and academies: in the Bronx (Hip Hop), Jamaica (Dancehall), South Korea (K-Pop), Cuba (Reggaeton), Ghana and Nigeria (Afrobeat), and in nightclubs worldwide (Heels, Twerk, Sexy Style).',
  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_origin:
    'The term "urban dance" groups a huge family of styles that share common DNA: they were born from popular culture, transmitted by imitation in the streets and evolved with contemporary urban music (rap, reggae, dancehall, trap, afrobeats). Unlike classical dance (ballet, contemporary, jazz), urban dances prioritize groove, musicality, attitude and personal expression over academic technique.',

  danzasUrbanas_whatIs_why_many_styles:
    'So many different styles exist because each was born in a unique cultural, geographical and musical context. Hip Hop emerged in the Bronx, New York with rap culture and breakdancing. Dancehall was born in Jamaica with soundsystems and reggae music. K-Pop evolved in South Korea fusing Western pop with Asian aesthetics. Afrobeat connects with modern African rhythms from Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa. Each style tells a different story, has its own codes and is danced with distinct energy.',
