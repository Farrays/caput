  philosophyBody1:
    'No effort will bring you more benefits than learning and practicing a dance. The endorphins you produce while dancing generate an immediate increase in serotonin, and with it, your level of well-being. When you dance, you smile more, you like yourself more, you are more sociable, more flexible, and more understanding. If there is one thing capable of changing your life from the very first moment, it is, without a doubt, dancing.',

    "More than a conventional dance school, what Yunaisy Farray and her team offer is a center that reflects their artistic ideals and way of life.

You'll find our center in a vibrant area with cafes and shops all around.",
  homeFaqQ2: "What sets Farray's apart from other dance academies in Barcelona?",
  homeFaqA2:
    "Farray's is not just another school: it was born from a love story for dance. We renovated a space abandoned for 10 years with our own hands because the school we dreamed of didn't exist. We're accredited by CID-UNESCO, we use the exclusive Farray Method® created by Yunaisy (dancer in Street Dance 2 and Got Talent), and above all, every student matters here. You're not a number: you're part of the family.",

  homeFaqA5:
    'Not at all. We have classes from absolute beginner level to advanced/professional. The Farray Method® is designed for you to progress quickly regardless of your starting point.

  dancehallFaqQ1: 'What exactly is dancehall?',
  dancehallFaqA1:
    "Dancehall is a style of music and dance that originated in Jamaica in the 70s. It's characterized by energetic movements, powerful rhythms ('riddims'), and a bold, confident attitude. It's much more than just steps: it's a complete cultural expression with its own history, music, and community. In our classes, you don't just learn the movements but also the culture and context behind them.",
  dancehallFaqQ2: 'Is dancehall difficult to learn?',
  dancehallFaqA2:
    'No more than any other dance style. Dancehall may seem intimidating at first due to its energy and rhythm, but our pedagogical approach breaks down each movement step by step. We start with the fundamentals (grooves, basic riddims) and advance gradually. Most of our beginner students are dancing full choreographies within a few weeks. The most important thing is attitude and the desire to have fun.',
  dancehallFaqQ3: 'Do I need to be in shape for dancehall classes?',
  dancehallFaqA3:
    "You don't need to be in specific shape to start. Dancehall itself is an excellent cardiovascular and endurance workout, so you'll improve your physical condition with each class. We work at different intensities and you can always adapt the movements to your current level. The important thing is to listen to your body and progress at your own pace.",
  dancehallFaqQ4: 'What should I wear to dancehall class?',
  // Classes FAQ
  dancehallFaqA4:
    "Comfortable, sporty clothing that allows you to move freely. Many students wear athletic pants or leggings and a t-shirt. For footwear, clean athletic shoes with good soles are ideal. Bring a water bottle because you're going to sweat! Optional: a small towel and your best attitude.",
  classesFaqQ1: "How many dance styles do you teach at Farray's Center?",
  classesFaqA1:
    'We offer training in over 25 different dance styles. Our catalog includes Latin dances (salsa, bachata, kizomba), urban dance (hip hop, dancehall, afrobeats, reggaeton), classical styles (ballet, contemporary, jazz), and specializations like physical preparation for dancers. This variety allows you to explore different styles and find those that resonate most with you, or specialize in one while complementing with others.',
  classesFaqQ2: 'Can I take classes in different styles at the same time?',
  classesFaqA2:
    'Of course! In fact, we recommend it. Learning multiple dance styles makes you a more complete and versatile dancer. For example, ballet improves your posture and technique for salsa, while hip hop can make your bachata more dynamic. Our class packages allow you to attend different types of classes according to your interests. Many of our most advanced students practice 3-4 styles simultaneously.',
  classesFaqQ3: 'How do I know which level is right for me?',
  classesFaqA3:
    "If it's your first class, we always recommend starting at the fundamentals or beginner level. However, if you have previous dance experience, our instructors can assess you in your first trial class and recommend the most appropriate level. You can also try an intermediate level class if you feel the fundamentals are too basic. The important thing is that you feel challenged but not overwhelmed.",
  classesFaqQ4: 'How often should I attend classes to see progress?',
  classesFaqA4:
    'For consistent and noticeable progress, we recommend attending at least twice a week. At this frequency, most students see significant improvements in 2-3 months. If you can attend 3-4 times a week, progress will be even faster. However, even a weekly class will allow you to advance, albeit at a more gradual pace. Consistency is more important than intensity.',
  classesFaqQ5: 'Do you offer private or only group classes?',
  // Dancehall Images
  classesFaqA5:
    "We offer both options. Group classes are excellent for learning in community, making friends, and benefiting from the group's energy.

  dhV3WhatIsP1:
    'Dancehall is a traditional Jamaican dance born in the 70s that reflects a culture with strong roots in reggae, African and Caribbean references, and the energy of hip-hop and other urban dances.',
  dhV3WhatIsP2:
    "Dancehall is much more than a dance: it's a way of walking, talking, and understanding life; a declaration of who you are. It's pure expression, rhythm, attitude, and flow. In Dancehall you don't have to be good, you have to be yourself.",
  dhV3WhatIsP3:
    'The contagious rhythms of Dancehall spread rapidly around the world, along with an attractive, energetic, and sensual dance style.',
  dhV3WhatIsP4:
    'Barcelona has become one of the most active Dancehall hubs in Europe, where culture and diversity are lived in every neighborhood.',
  dhV3WhatIsQuestionTitle: "Wondering if it's for you?",
  dhV3WhatIsQuestionAnswer: 'Yes, it is.',
  dhV3CulturalTitle: 'Dancehall History and Culture',
  dhV3CulturalShort:
    'Dancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 70s as a natural evolution of reggae.',
  dhV3CulturalFull:
    '### The origins: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s–1980s)\n\nDancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 70s. It emerged as a natural evolution of reggae when sound systems (mobile sound systems) began taking music to the streets and dancehalls. The name "dancehall" comes from those spaces where the community gathered to dance, socialize, and express themselves. It was where social tensions were released through music and movement.\n\n### The legends: Bogle, Passa Passa, and the pioneers\n\nGerald "Bogle" Levy (1964–2005) is considered the father of modern Dancehall. He created iconic moves like Bogle, Row Di Boat, Log On, and Willie Bounce, the foundation of the Dancehall vocabulary. Passa Passa, the legendary street dancehall sessions in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston), was the epicenter where new steps were born and dancers were consecrated. Other pioneers like Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype, and crews like Ravers Clavers took Dancehall international in the 2000s.\n\n### Global expansion (2000s–present)\n\nIn the 2000s, Dancehall exploded globally thanks to artists like Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man. Social media and YouTube popularized steps like Dutty Wine, Daggering, and Nuh Linga. Today, Dancehall is a worldwide phenomenon with active communities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America; Barcelona is one of its European epicenters.\n\n### The music: Riddims and Sound System culture\n\nDancehall is danced to riddims (instrumental bases) that producers create and multiple artists voice over. Legendary riddims like Diwali, Coolie Dance, or Dump Truck defined entire eras. Sound system culture—with its selectors, MCs, and the famous rewind when a song is so good it gets replayed from the start—is essential to understanding Dancehall.\n\n### More than dance: identity and resistance\n\nDancehall has always been a form of cultural resistance and identity expression for Jamaica\'s marginalized communities. It\'s the voice of the ghettos, a celebration of joy despite difficulties. Each step has meaning: Log On (connect), Willie Bounce (tribute to Willie Haggart), Nuh Linga (don\'t delay). Every movement tells a story.',

    'We have 11 urban styles: Hip Hop (Old School and New Style), Jamaican Dancehall, K-Pop, Cuban Reggaeton, Sexy Reggaeton, Twerk, Afrobeat, Femmology Heels, Commercial Dance, Sexy Style and Hip Hop Reggaeton. Each style with specific classes by level.',
  urbanFaqQ2: 'Do I need previous experience to take Hip Hop or Dancehall classes?',
  urbanFaqA2:
    'No. We have groups for absolute beginners who have never danced urban. Each style has levels from beginner to advanced. You will learn the fundamentals step by step with specialized teachers.',
  urbanFaqQ3: "What makes Farray's Center's Dancehall different from other schools?",
  urbanFaqA3:
    "We teach Jamaican Dancehall as it's danced in Kingston, with the steps that set trends on the world scene: Wacky Dip, Willy Bounce, Log On, Nuh Linga. You learn the original vocabulary with real Caribbean flow, not adaptations. Direct training from the source.",
  urbanFaqQ4: 'What clothes and shoes do I need for urban dance classes?',
  urbanFaqA4:
    "Comfortable sportswear (joggers, loose t-shirt or crop top) and street dance sneakers or sneakers with good cushioning. For Heels: 8-12 cm heels with platform and rubber sole. For Twerk: fitted clothing (shorts or leggings). We'll advise you in your first class.",
  urbanFaqQ5: 'Can I combine Hip Hop with Dancehall or K-Pop?',
  urbanFaqA5:
    "Yes, it's highly recommended. Hip Hop develops your musicality and fundamentals, Dancehall brings Caribbean flow, and K-Pop improves precision and performance. Many students combine 2-3 styles to develop complete versatility.",
  urbanFaqQ6: 'Do you organize battles or urban events where students can participate?',
  urbanFaqA6:
    'Yes. We organize Hip Hop and Dancehall Battles throughout the year, Urban Showcases in Barcelona venues, and participate in national competitions. We also organize an Annual Gala with choreographies of all urban styles in a professional theater.',
  urbanFaqQ7: 'How long does it take to learn a K-Pop or Hip Hop choreography?',
  urbanFaqA7:
    'It depends on the level. Beginners learn simple choreographies in 4-6 classes. With intermediate level, you can master a complete K-Pop choreography (3-4 minutes) in 6-8 classes. Hip Hop freestyle requires more time (3-6 months) to develop your own style.',
  urbanFaqQ8: 'Are there urban dance classes for adults without experience?',
  urbanFaqA8:
    'Absolutely. Many adults start from scratch in urban and discover their passion. We have specific groups for beginner adults in Hip Hop, Dancehall, K-Pop and Reggaeton. Urban culture has no age limit, it only requires attitude and desire.',
  urbanFaqQ9: 'Where is the urban dance school located?',
  urbanFaqA9:
    'We are at Calle Entença 100, 08015 Barcelona, just 5 minutes walk from Plaza España and Sants Station. Metro: L1 (Hostafrancs) / L3 (Tarragona, Plaza España). Train: Sants Estació. Buses: 13, 37, 65, 79, 109, 165.',

  prepFisicaFaqQ1: 'What is physical preparation for dancers and how does it differ from the gym?',
  prepFisicaFaqA1:
    "It's specific training designed for dancer needs: explosive strength for jumps, core for turns, active flexibility, endurance for choreographies and injury prevention. Unlike conventional gym, every exercise has direct application in dance.",
  prepFisicaFaqQ2: 'Do I need previous experience in physical training?',
  prepFisicaFaqA2:
    'No. Classes are adapted to all levels. If you dance, you already have the foundation. We teach you correct technique for each exercise from scratch and progress according to your current fitness level.',
  prepFisicaFaqQ3:
    'How many times per week should I train physical preparation if I already take dance classes?',
  prepFisicaFaqA3:
    'Ideal: 2-3 weekly sessions of 45-60 minutes. If you dance 4-5 times per week, 2 physical preparation sessions are enough to see significant improvements in strength, flexibility and injury prevention.',
  prepFisicaFaqQ4: 'Will physical preparation help me prevent injuries?',
  prepFisicaFaqA4:
    'Yes. We strengthen vulnerable areas (ankles, knees, hips, lower back), correct muscle imbalances, improve proprioception and teach safe movement patterns. You drastically reduce the risk of common injuries.',
  prepFisicaFaqQ5: 'Will I gain a lot of muscle volume with this training?',
  prepFisicaFaqA5:
    'No. Training is designed to develop functional strength, explosiveness and muscular endurance without excessive hypertrophy. You get a strong, agile and aesthetic body, perfect for dancing.',
  prepFisicaFaqQ6: 'Can I improve my flexibility with physical preparation?',
  prepFisicaFaqA6:
    "Yes. We include specific flexibility sessions with active stretching, PNF, joint mobility and range of motion exercises. Many students achieve splits and extensions they didn't have before.",
  prepFisicaFaqQ7: 'Will this training help me jump higher and turn better?',
  prepFisicaFaqA7:
    "Absolutely. We work on explosive leg strength for jumps, core and stability for controlled turns, and proprioception for balance. You'll see direct improvements in your dance technique.",
  prepFisicaFaqQ8: 'What clothing and footwear do I need for physical preparation classes?',
  prepFisicaFaqA8:
    'Comfortable sportswear (leggings, technical t-shirt) and training shoes with good cushioning. For flexibility exercises, many prefer to train barefoot or with non-slip socks.',
  prepFisicaFaqQ9: 'Can I combine physical preparation with my dance classes?',
  prepFisicaFaqA9:
    'Yes, highly recommended. Physical preparation complements your dance training: improves technical performance, prevents injuries and accelerates your progress. Many dancers combine 3-4 dance classes + 2 physical preparation weekly.',

  salsaBachataFaqQ1: "What styles of salsa and bachata are taught at Farray's Center Barcelona?",
  salsaBachataFaqA1:
    "At Farray's Center we teach Cuban Salsa, Sensual Bachata, Bachata Lady Style, Cuban Timba, Son Cubano, Salsa Lady Style, Salsa Lady Timba, Men Style and Cuban Folklore. Our teachers are graduates of the National School of Art of Cuba and have experience in Havana's best academies, guaranteeing authenticity and quality in every class.",
  salsaBachataFaqQ2: 'Do I need to bring a partner for salsa or bachata classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA2:
    "No, you don't need to bring a partner. In our partner dance classes (salsa, bachata, timba) we constantly rotate so everyone has the opportunity to dance with different partners. This helps you develop your connection technique and feel comfortable dancing with anyone. We also offer individual Lady Style and Men Style classes if you prefer to focus on your personal technique.",
  salsaBachataFaqQ3: "What's the difference between Cuban Salsa and other salsa styles?",
  salsaBachataFaqA3:
    'Cuban Salsa is danced in a circle and has a more circular, joyful and "street" style compared to Salsa on Line (LA Style or NY Style). Cuban incorporates Afro-Cuban, son and rumba movements. It\'s very social: you can dance in rueda de casino (several dancers in a circle) or in pairs. At Farray\'s we teach authentic Cuban salsa with teachers from Havana.',
  salsaBachataFaqQ4: 'What level do I need to start salsa or bachata classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA4:
    "None. We have classes for all levels: Beginner (you've never danced), Basic (you know the basic steps), Intermediate (you dance fluently and know figures) and Advanced (you master technique and musicality). If you've never danced salsa or bachata, start in our Beginner classes where we teach you from scratch: basic step, musical timing, partner connection and first figures.",
  salsaBachataFaqQ5: 'How long does it take to learn to dance salsa or bachata?',
  salsaBachataFaqA5:
    "It depends on your dedication, but with consistent practice (2-3 classes per week) you can dance confidently in 2-3 months. To master the technique, advanced musicality and complex figures, we recommend at least 6-12 months. Many of our advanced students have been perfecting their style for years and never stop learning. What's important is to enjoy the process from day one.",
  salsaBachataFaqQ6: "What's the difference between Sensual Bachata and Bachata Lady Style?",
  salsaBachataFaqA6:
    'Sensual Bachata is danced in pairs with connection, body waves, dips and isolations inspired by zouk and contemporary. Bachata Lady Style focuses on individual feminine dancing: footwork technique, hip movement, arms, waves and attitude, perfect for shining alone on the dance floor or perfecting your technique before partner dancing. Both complement each other: Sensual for connection, Lady Style for personal technique.',
  salsaBachataFaqQ7: 'Do salsa and bachata classes include live music?',
  salsaBachataFaqA7:
    "Our regular classes use recorded music from the best salsa and bachata artists (Celia Cruz, El Gran Combo, Marc Anthony, Romeo Santos, Prince Royce, etc.). However, we organize special events, Latin parties and workshops with live musicians where you can practice what you've learned in a festive and authentic atmosphere. We also collaborate with salsa festivals in Barcelona.",
  salsaBachataFaqQ8: 'Do you offer Rueda de Casino classes?',
  salsaBachataFaqA8:
    'Yes, Rueda de Casino is an integral part of our Cuban Salsa classes. Rueda is a modality where multiple couples dance in a circle and a "cantante" (caller) announces the figures that everyone executes at the same time. It\'s very fun, social and traditional in Cuba. To dance rueda you need to first master the basic steps of Cuban salsa and the main figures.',
  salsaBachataFaqQ9: 'Where is the salsa and bachata school located?',
  salsaBachataFaqA9:
    'We are at Calle Entença 100, 08015 Barcelona, just 5 minutes walk from Plaza España and Sants Station. Metro: L1 (Hostafrancs) / L3 (Tarragona, Plaza España). Train: Sants Estació. Buses: 13, 37, 65, 79, 109, 165. We have spacious, air-conditioned rooms with special dance flooring.',

  hipHopCulturalShort: `El Hip Hop nació en el sur del Bronx a mediados de los años 70 como una respuesta creativa de las comunidades marginadas.`,
  hipHopCulturalFull: `### Los orígenes: El Bronx, Nueva York (1970s)\n\nEl Hip Hop nació en el sur del Bronx a mediados de los años 70. Surgió en las block parties (fiestas callejeras) organizadas por DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa y Grandmaster Flash. Estos pioneros crearon el "breakbeat" (repetir la parte más bailable de una canción) y dieron vida a una cultura que transformaría el mundo. El Hip Hop nació de cuatro elementos: el MC (el rapero), el DJ (quien controla la música), el Breaking (el baile) y el Graffiti (el arte visual).\n\n### Los fundadores: De las calles a la revolución global\n\nDJ Kool Herc es considerado el padre del Hip Hop. Con sus dos tornamesas y su sistema de sonido, creó el concepto del "merry-go-round" (repetir breaks instrumentales). Afrika Bambaataa fundó la Zulu Nation, promoviendo paz, unidad y creatividad. Grandmaster Flash perfeccionó técnicas como el scratching y el punch phrasing. Los Rock Steady Crew llevaron el breaking a nivel mundial. Crews como New York City Breakers, Electric Boogaloos y The Lockers definieron estilos que aún se enseñan hoy.\n\n### La expansión global (1980s–presente)\n\nEn los años 80, el Hip Hop explotó globalmente gracias a películas como Beat Street, Wild Style y Breakin\\'. La música rap cruzó fronteras con artistas como Run-DMC, Public Enemy, N.W.A y Tupac. En los 90 y 2000, el New Style trajo coreografías más elaboradas gracias a videoclips de artistas como Missy Elliott, Aaliyah y Chris Brown. Hoy, el Hip Hop es un fenómeno mundial con comunidades activas en todos los continentes; Barcelona es uno de sus epicentros europeos.\n\n### La música: Beats, samples y cultura de DJ\n\nEl Hip Hop se baila sobre beats creados por productores que samplear (tomar fragmentos de) discos de funk, soul, jazz y R&B. Productores legendarios como J Dilla, Dr. Dre, DJ Premier y Timbaland definieron épocas enteras. La cultura del DJ —con sus scratches, samples y el arte de mezclar— es esencial para entender el Hip Hop.\n\n### Más que baile: identidad y empoderamiento\n\nEl Hip Hop ha sido siempre una forma de empoderamiento cultural y expresión de identidad para las comunidades marginadas. Es la voz de las calles, una celebración de la creatividad a pesar de las dificultades. Cada estilo tiene un mensaje: el Breaking muestra fuerza y resistencia, el Popping es control y precisión, el Locking es celebración y diversión. Cada movimiento cuenta una historia.`,

Estos movimientos ancestrales han viajado a través de los siglos y continentes, llegando al Caribe y posteriormente a Estados Unidos durante el período de esclavitud y la diáspora africana. En las décadas de 1980 y 1990, el Twerk comenzó a aparecer en videos musicales de hip-hop y bounce music de Nueva Orleans, popularizado por artistas como DJ Jubilee. El término "twerk" se popularizó masivamente en 2013 gracias a artistas como Miley Cyrus, pero el baile ya llevaba décadas siendo parte fundamental de la cultura del hip-hop y la música urbana. Hoy en día, el Twerk ha evolucionado como una forma de expresión artística que combina el poder ancestral de las danzas africanas con la actitud y energía de la música urbana contemporánea, siendo practicado por bailarines profesionales en todo el mundo como una disciplina que fortalece el cuerpo y la confianza personal.',

  dancehallCulturalFull: '### Los Orígenes: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s-1980s)\n\nEl Dancehall nació en los guetos de Kingston, Jamaica, a finales de los años 70. Surgió como una evolución natural del reggae, cuando los "sound systems" (sistemas de sonido móviles) empezaron a llevar la música a las calles y a los dancehalls (salas de dance).\n\nEl nombre "dancehall" proviene literalmente de estos espacios donde la community se reunía para to dance, socializar y expresarse. Era el lugar donde las tensiones sociales se liberaban a través de la música y el movement.\n\n### Las Leyendas: Bogle, Passa Passa y Los Pioneros\n\nGerald "Bogle" Levy (1964-2005) es considerado el padre del dancehall moderno. Creó movements icónicos como el "Bogle", "Row Di Boat", "Log On" y "Willie Bounce" que se convirtieron en la base del vocabulario dancehall.\n\nPassa Passa, las sesiones legendarias de street dancehall todos los miércoles en Tivoli Gardens, Kingston, se convirtieron en el epicentro donde nacían los nuevos pasos y se consagraban los dancers.\n\nOtros pioneers como Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype y crews como Ravers Clavers llevaron el dancehall a nivel internacional en los 2000s.\n\n### La Expansión Global (2000s-Presente)\n\nEn los años 2000, el dancehall explotó globalmente gracias a artistas como Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man y Beenie Man. Las redes sociales y YouTube permitieron que pasos como el "Dutty Wine", "Daggering" y "Nuh Linga" se viralizaran mundialmente.\n\nHoy, el dancehall es un fenómeno global con communityes activas en Europa, África, Asia y América. Barcelona se ha convertido en uno de los epicentros europeos del dancehall auténtico.\n\n### La Música: Riddims y Cultura Soundsystem\n\nEl dancehall se baila sobre "riddims" (rhythms instrumentales) que los productores crean y múltiples artistas vocalizan. Riddims legendarios como "Diwali", "Coolie Dance" o "Dump Truck" han definido épocas enteras.\n\nLa culture del sound system —con sus selectores, MCs y el famoso "rewind" cuando una canción es tan buena que se vuelve a poner desde el principio— es fundamental para entender el dancehall.\n\n### Más Que Baile: Identidad y Resistencia\n\nEl dancehall ha sido siempre una forma de endurance culturel y expression de identidad para las communityes marginadas de Jamaica. Es la voz de los guetos, una celebración de la alegría a pesar de las dificultades.\n\nLos pasos tienen nombres con significado: "Log On" (conectarse), "Willie Bounce" (homenaje a Willie Haggart), "Nuh Linga" (no te demores). Cada movement cuenta una historia.',
  dancehallCulturalShort: 'El Dancehall es una dance tradicional jamaicana que nació en los años 70 y refleja una culture con fuertes raíces en el reggae, referencias africanas y caribeñas, y la energy del hip-hop y otras dances urbanas. Dancehall es mucho más que un dance; es una manera de andar, de hablar y de entender la vida; es una declaración de quién eres. Es expression pura, rhythm, actitud y flow. En el dancehall no hay que ser bueno, hay que ser tú.',
