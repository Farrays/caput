  salsaBachata_whatIs_title: 'What is Salsa Cubana and Bachata?',
  salsaBachata_whatIs_salsa:
    "Salsa Cubana is much more than a dance: it's a cultural expression born in Cuba that fuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms (son, rumba, mambo, cha-cha-cha) with jazz and other styles. It's characterized by circular movements in pairs (rueda de casino), quick footwork, free body expression and a deep connection with the music. It's the most social and festive salsa style, perfect for group dancing and enjoying improvisation.",
  salsaBachata_whatIs_bachata:
    "Bachata is a sensual and romantic dance originating from the Dominican Republic. It was born in working-class neighborhoods in the 1960s and evolved to become one of the most popular Latin dances in the world. It's danced in pairs with marked hip movements, simple basic steps (side-to-side with tap) and fluid turns. There are several styles: Dominican Bachata (traditional), Sensual Bachata (modern, with body waves) and Bachata Fusion.",
